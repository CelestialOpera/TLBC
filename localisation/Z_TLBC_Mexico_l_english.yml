 ##Character Descriptions
 POLITICS_LAZARO_CARDENAS_DESC:0 "Lázaro Cárdenas was born May 21, 1895, in the town of Jiquilpan, Michoacán. Cárdenas served in the Mexican Civil War, in the Constitutional Army where he rose to the rank of General. In the 1920s Cárdenas was in a prison until he was released in exchange for commanding armies in 1927 during a counter revolutionary revolt in Yucatan. Following the war, Cárdenas was promoted and given a position in government after he declared loyalty to the socialist cause under President Francisco 'Pancho' Villa and party Chairman Emiliano Zapata; his position was that of Chief of The Mexican Military and he was also given a position in the national legislature made up solely of PPMU members.\n\nFollowing the arrest and exile of Emiliano Zapata, Cárdenas was promoted rapidly through the ranks of the party and government from the head of the Michoacán Division of the Party, then Governor of Michoacán, and finally he became Chairman of the PPMU in 1938. President Villa saw Cárdenas as a strong ally but what he didn't know was that he cared little about the President and saw through his growing personality cult; this all came to light during the Party Congress of 1949. The Party Congress of 1949 was assembled following a heart attack that struck President Villa, Cárdenas was approached very quickly by people who opposed Villa and his personality cult and Cárdenas with support of the party removed President Villa from the party, and his position as President. The Eliminación Crisis followed Villa's removal, it was an event that saw numerous forces loyal to Pancho Villa attempt to occupy Mexico City but swiftly shut down by Chairman Cárdenas and forces under his command in about two weeks.\n\nFollowing the Eliminación crisis, Lázaro Cárdenas was named President of Mexico where he began to enact numerous reforms similar to that seen under President Wang Jingwei in China, a man that Cárdenas has cited as a major influence. Under his nationalist and socialist guidance, Mexico's economy flourished and he was celebrated and praised and following the praise he also began to liberalize the country. While the country under Pancho Villa wasn't very totalitarian, it did hold many authoritarian aspects; Cárdenas kept the mandatory party membership law for government officials but made it much easier to gain access to Party membership, but most importantly he made the national legislature an elected body of party members where all citizens could vote.\n\nYes President Cárdenas is loved throughout Mexico, many even calling him the 'Nuevo Padre' but with his growing age they can't help but wonder what is next from the Nuevo Padre." #but he doesn't take his cult of personality lightly, often trying to prevent himself from becoming an idol like his predecessor. Cárdenas has refused to allow for streets, towns, schools, or boats to be named after him, he has not had statues commissioned in his honor, and when holding military parades he often stays out of uniform and puts himself behind the soldiers he views as the stars of the show. With his growing age however, many wonder what is in store for the Nuevo Padre.
